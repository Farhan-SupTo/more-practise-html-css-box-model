            <h3>Burger</h1>
                <p>A hamburger or burger is an American fast food. It is a type of sandwich with a patty of cooked ground meat between the two halves of a bun. Tomatoes, onions, cheese, salad and dips may also be added. The hamburger may be eaten without a knife and fork, so it is a fast food which can be eaten anywhere.

                    Hamburgers are named for a city in Germany called Hamburg. They were probably invented in Germany, though what we now know as a hamburger was created in the United States in the 19th century. Hamburgers appeared on menus in England and the United States in the 19th century, and became a popular food after the 1904 World's Fair.[1][2][3] What is called a hamburger throughout the world today was different than the first German hamburgers; German dishes often involved a steak or sausage between pieces of bread instead of ground meat.
                    
                    Many American fast food restaurants, such as Burger King, Wendy's and McDonald's, serve hamburgers.[4]

            <h3>Pizza</h1>
                <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, made with an oven-baked, flat, generally round bread that is often covered with tomatoes or a tomato-based sauce and mozzarella cheese. Other toppings are added according to region, culture, or personal preference. Originating as a part of Italian cuisine, the dish has become popular in many different parts of the world, particularly the United States, where numerous varieties have been developed, pizza restaurant chains have flourished, and pizza has become a home delivery item as well as being available as a frozen food ready to bake at home.

                    Today, pizza is a symbol of several cultures: Italians, particularly from Naples, are proud of authentic pizza made with local ingredients and following strict guidelines for preparation. In the United States, pizza has iconic status as a typical American food, quickly prepared and readily available, and enjoyed by people of all ages at social occasions as well as family meals. The different styles, from places such as New York City and Chicago, reflect the diversity of American culture. Countries throughout the world have adopted pizza as a favorite food, adding their own variations to make this dish their own.</p>
