            <h3>Burger</h1>
                <p>A hamburger or burger is an American fast food. It is a type of sandwich with a patty of cooked ground meat between the two halves of a bun. Tomatoes, onions, cheese, salad and dips may also be added. The hamburger may be eaten without a knife and fork, so it is a fast food which can be eaten anywhere.

                    Hamburgers are named for a city in Germany called Hamburg. They were probably invented in Germany, though what we now know as a hamburger was created in the United States in the 19th century. Hamburgers appeared on menus in England and the United States in the 19th century, and became a popular food after the 1904 World's Fair.[1][2][3] What is called a hamburger throughout the world today was different than the first German hamburgers; German dishes often involved a steak or sausage between pieces of bread instead of ground meat.
                    
                    Many American fast food restaurants, such as Burger King, Wendy's and McDonald's, serve hamburgers.[4]

                    A cheeseburger is a hamburger that also has cheese. Hamburgers can be served with other things besides cheese, such as chili, or even guacamole.This is arguably the most debated topic, holding alot of misconception in the minds of alot of people. A hamburger is called a hamburger not because of the patty or the filling it has, but because of the place of it’s origin. 

                    Hamburgers are called hamburgers because they originate from Hamburg, Germany. Rather, it gets its name from the origin of the burger. Hamburg, Germany has the credit for making the modern-day hamburger.
                    
                    However, They were not  the ones who came up with the concept. According to the Online Dictionary, the hamburger is “the meat product so called from 1880 (as hamburg steak), named for the German city, though no certain connection has ever been put forth.” 
                    
                    The idea of the hamburger, however, might have appeared in first-century Rome, where there is a record of ground or minced meat that was flavored with pepper, wine, and pine nuts
                    
                    But how did this minced beef patty become the sandwich we know as the hamburger? 
                    
                    The history isn’t completely clear. Some credit brothers Frank and Charles Menches with putting a patty between two slices of bread in the aptly named town of Hamburg, New York, in 1885.</p>

            <h3>Pizza</h1>
                <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, made with an oven-baked, flat, generally round bread that is often covered with tomatoes or a tomato-based sauce and mozzarella cheese. Other toppings are added according to region, culture, or personal preference. Originating as a part of Italian cuisine, the dish has become popular in many different parts of the world, particularly the United States, where numerous varieties have been developed, pizza restaurant chains have flourished, and pizza has become a home delivery item as well as being available as a frozen food ready to bake at home.

                    Today, pizza is a symbol of several cultures: Italians, particularly from Naples, are proud of authentic pizza made with local ingredients and following strict guidelines for preparation. In the United States, pizza has iconic status as a typical American food, quickly prepared and readily available, and enjoyed by people of all ages at social occasions as well as family meals. The different styles, from places such as New York City and Chicago, reflect the diversity of American culture. Countries throughout the world have adopted pizza as a favorite food, adding their own variations to make this dish their own.Pizza is the world’s favourite fast food. We eat it everywhere – at home, in restaurants, on street corners. Some three billion pizzas are sold each year in the United States alone, an average of 46 slices per person. But the story of how the humble pizza came to enjoy such global dominance reveals much about the history of migration, economics and technological change.

                    People have been eating pizza, in one form or another, for centuries. As far back as antiquity, pieces of flatbread, topped with savouries, served as a simple and tasty meal for those who could not afford plates, or who were on the go. These early pizzas appear in Virgil’s Aeneid. Shortly after arriving in Latium, Aeneas and his crew sat down beneath a tree and laid out ‘thin wheaten cakes as platters for their meal’. They then scattered them with mushrooms and herbs they had found in the woods and guzzled them down, crust and all, prompting Aeneas’ son Ascanius to exclaim: “Look! We’ve even eaten our plates!”</p>

            <h3>Ice-cream</h1>
                <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.

                    Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held by the hands as finger food. Ice cream may be served with other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as an ingredient in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes—or in baked items such as Baked Alaska.Ice cream's origins are known to reach back as far as the second century B.C., although no specific date of origin nor inventor has been undisputably credited with its discovery. We know that Alexander the Great enjoyed snow and ice flavored with honey and nectar. Biblical references also show that King Solomon was fond of iced drinks during harvesting. During the Roman Empire, Nero Claudius Caesar (A.D. 54-86) frequently sent runners into the mountains for snow, which was then flavored with fruits and juices.

                    Over a thousand years later, Marco Polo returned to Italy from the Far East with a recipe that closely resembled what is now called sherbet. Historians estimate that this recipe evolved into ice cream sometime in the 16th century. England seems to have discovered ice cream at the same time, or perhaps even earlier than the Italians. "Cream Ice," as it was called, appeared regularly at the table of Charles I during the 17th century. France was introduced to similar frozen desserts in 1553 by the Italian Catherine de Medici when she became the wife of Henry II of France. It wasn't until 1660 that ice cream was made available to the general public. The Sicilian Procopio introduced a recipe blending milk, cream, butter and eggs at Café Procope, the first café in Paris.</p>
